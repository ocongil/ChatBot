Salamun draws from a wide range of experiences including serving in the U.S. Air Force, guiding Organizational Development and Branding at a Fortune 500, Vice President of Operations at Black Hills Federal Credit Union, and Executive Pastor at Fountain Springs Church. Born in west Texas, Salamun moved to Rapid City in the late 1980's. He was locally educated attending Canyon Lake Elementary, West Middle School, Stevens High School, and Black Hills State University. While in the military, he was stationed in Colorado Springs, CO from 1996-2000. Following his military service, he returned home to Rapid City to plant roots and raise his family. Fueled by a desire to make a positive impact in our community, Salamun has been involved in numerous civic, non-profit, and ministry initiatives over the years. Heâ€™s also had the opportunity to present to a wide variety of audiences as a speaker, trainer, and storyteller. Jason was elected to City Council in 2016 and in June of 2023 Jason was elected Mayor of Rapid City.  Mayor's Annual Budget Presentation to City Council  2022 Budget  2021 Budget
